# Own Your OSINT: How To Minimze Your Digital Footprint

In a world that is increasingly LESS private but more convenient, where do you draw the line? How much of your personal privacy, data, and life are you willing to give to corpa, government, and the general public for the conveniences they offer in return?

I'm Asira. Around halfway through high school I decided to see how much information I could dig up on myself. My rules: I had to start with my name and general location only. I was horrified to find my full legal name, birthdate, many phots, videos, and audio clips of me. I found my home city. My city of birth. Contact information. Enough information to ruin my life if I wanted to.

At the time I didn't know what Open Source Intelligence was. Generally speaking, OSINT is publicly available information about a person or person(s). OSINT leverages various techniques to create a "profile" on someone(s). It is widely used in the realm of journalism, private investagion, and even in background checks (both professional, private, and government levels).

I've come a long way since high school. I've even been invited to talk on OSINT and privacy. This repository is an information-dense introduction to personal privacy and security. How to defend aginst OSINT probes so to speak.

As time goes on and I learn more, I may add to this repository, so feel free to follow it. If you'd like to use any of the resources here, please cite your source and link it back to me. I'd also appreciate it if you dropped a donation to my [BuyMeACoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/realasira) if you really appreciate the resources I've provided.

Thank you, and good luck out there!


## Website (minimal docs-style index)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
